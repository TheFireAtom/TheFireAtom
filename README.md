## 🎨 Fun & Side Projects

While I enjoy building practical things, I also love coding just for fun! ✨  
Here are some of my side explorations:

- 🎮 **Game prototypes** (e.g., console-based Battle City clone 🚀).  
- 🕹️ **Vibecoding projects** — experiments with random ideas just for creativity.  
- 🤖 **Bots & scripts** that automate everyday stuff.  

I believe **programming should be fun**, and sometimes the best ideas come from playful experiments! 🎉
